COMP30027 Machine Learning assignment 2

A Twitter sentiment analysis is performed to predict whether a particular tweet is positive, neutral, or negative. For more info, read the assignment spec.

I'm putting this on GitHub because the subject has ended. If there exists any future assignment which is similar to this one, it's not my fault.

P.S. to future Machine Learning students: do not take this subject if Ni or/and Hasti is in charge. They will somehow turn the most interesting subject materials into a baffling boring mess with little to no useful interaction to students as well as disorganised assignments.
