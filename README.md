# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
COMP30027 Machine Learning assignment 2

A Twitter sentiment analysis is performed to predict whether a particular tweet is positive, neutral, or negative. For more info, read the assignment spec.

P.S. I'm putting this on GitHub because the subject has ended. If there exists any future assignment which is similar to this one, it's not my responsibility. Also, the report was supposed to be a scientific report, something which I did not really bother because my report does not have a proper title and the tables are screenshots instead of actual tables. Nevertheless, ignoring all those stuff, I personally think the content is good enough to be posted here.
